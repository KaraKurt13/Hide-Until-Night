 2D Sandbox game similar to Terraria and Don't Starve. Basic, completed, functionality:
- character movement;
- randomly generated world;
- game interface:
- change of day and night (with a smooth transition of time, including morning and evening);
- interaction with the world (collecting resources, hiding in the grass);
- Inventory and items systems;
- construction system;
- melting objects (wood into coal, ore into iron, etc.);
- animation of all actions of the character.

Requires improvement:
- Enemies AI states machine, changing enemy states depending on the current time of day.
- World generation (different biomes);
